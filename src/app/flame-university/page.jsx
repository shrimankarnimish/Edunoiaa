                Through a decade-long partnership, ABND has served as the brand
                partner overseeing FLAME University's strategic brand evolution.
                This collaboration began in 2011 with foundational work in
                branding and communication, smoothly progressing through a
                comprehensive rebranding, positioning, and brand identity effort
                upon the institute's attainment of University status. ABND
                undertook the university's experiential branding, conceptualised
                and executed branded flagship events, and, most notably, in
                2022, played a key role in refining the repositioning strategy
                and communication.

              </h6>
              <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed font-sans font-normal mb-4">
                Despite being the pioneers of Liberal Education in India, the
                main challenge FLAME faced was getting parents to understand the
                meaning and value of liberal education. To give Liberal
                Education a new form and to establish what it truly meant at
                FLAME University, ABND conducted in-depth qualitative research
                with 4 key stakeholders – the faculty, parents, students (FLAME
                and non-FLAME) and alumni, through a process that involved
                interviewing over 300 people.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed font-sans font-normal mb-4">
                ABND realised that students and parents chose FLAME because of
                the diverse perspectives that the University helped build.
                Therefore, the Brand Essence for the 'new' brand of FLAME
                University was 'Diversity of the Mind.' This fresh brand thought
                revolved around the seamless blend of diverse disciplines upon
                one unified platform, thereby creating a culture of complete
                learning that is not one dimensional. FLAME believed that the
                real world does not function in silos and therefore, neither
                should education.

                The visual identity of FLAME University, embodied in its crest,
                ingeniously encapsulated the institution's multidimensional
                learning ethos. Centred around a dynamic 'F', the emblem derived
                inspiration from FLAME's fundamental tenets of liberal
                education, emphasising its interdisciplinary and diverse nature.

                Brand Repositioning in 2020:
              </h6>
              <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed font-sans font-normal mb-4">
                Amidst a landscape where numerous institutes, schools, colleges,
                and more laid claim to interdisciplinary curriculum in the wake
                of the introduction of the NEP 2020, FLAME recognised the
                imperative to distinguish itself as the vanguard of Liberal
                Education in India. With a legacy of over a decade at the
                forefront of knowledge, FLAME embarked on a journey to redefine
                Liberal Education. This endeavour necessitated a comprehensive
                exploration of stakeholder perspectives over a six-month period.
                Through in-depth interviews with various constituents including
                parents, students, alumni, faculty members, and institutional
                leaders, ABND sought to uncover prevailing perceptions and
                future aspirations, ultimately guiding the articulation of its
                Brand Essence.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed font-sans font-normal mb-4">
                ABND identified that distinguishing itself from institutions
                merely offering academic and extracurricular activities, FLAME
                University was committed to outcomes-driven education, extending
                its influence beyond the confines of student years to cultivate
                lifelong connections with its alumni and faculty community. The
                positioning for FLAME was crafted to go beyond just learning for
                life, but rather be an association for life. This was translated
                to the idea of 'Everlasting'
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed font-sans font-normal mb-4">
                To operationalise this essence, ABND categorised all of FLAME's
                offerings into ten distinct propositions. Each
                proposition—Everlasting Learning, Experiences, Impact, Insight,
                Connections, Support, Moments, Inspiration, Legacy, and
                Purpose—reflects FLAME's commitment to holistic development and
                impactful experiences, thereby reaffirming its status as a
                trailblazer of Liberal Education in India.

                In embodying the concept of Everlasting, FLAME University's
                visual language drew inspiration from the boundless expanse of
                the horizon. This imagery aimed to symbolise the perpetual
                connection that FLAME cultivates throughout a student's
                journey—from the initial encounter before joining the FLAME
                community to their transition into the professional realm and
                beyond. A comprehensive revamping of all university collaterals
                and communication was conducted across both physical and digital
                touchpoints.

                  especially in the face of the unique challenges presented by
                  the year 2021. Through curated discussions and insights shared

                  The FLAME Vivekananda Library stands as a testament to
                  excellence, boasting a state-of-the-art facility and an
                  extensive collection of books, academic journals, and digital
                  resources. ABND's design approach prioritised both
                  functionality and aesthetic harmony. Strategic foresight
                  guided the design process, ensuring that the library's layout
                  and systems could accommodate future growth and evolving needs
                  without compromising efficiency or coherence. Within its
                  walls, the library offers more than just books; it serves as a
                  dynamic hub for intellectual exchange and collaboration.
                  Discussion rooms facilitate group work sessions, a computer
                  lab provides access to a wealth of online resources, and a
                  diverse media section offers a glimpse into both foreign and
                  Indian cinema. The Reprographics section further enhances
                  accessibility, while the inviting Library Café and Lounge
                  provide spaces for relaxation and rejuvenation. In paying
                  homage to the architectural legacy of B.V. Doshi, ABND ensured
                  that every aspect of the library experience, from browsing
                  shelves to engaging with staff, evokes a sense of wonder and
                  inspiration.
